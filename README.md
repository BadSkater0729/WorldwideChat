### WorldwideChat is a translation plugin for Bukkit, Spigot, and PaperMC 1.13+.
It allows you to translate various parts of Minecraft live using several Translation APIs.
Some of its notable features include:
- Amazon Translate, Azure Translate, DeepL Translate, Google Translate, IBM Watson, Libre Translate, and Systran Translate support.
- Translate incoming/outgoing chat, signs, entities, and written books with an interactive GUI.
- Translation globally, for other players, or just you.
- The plugin itself has been localized into more than 30 languages thanks to Amazon Translate.
- A cache that stores the most used phrases by players on your server, improving speed/reliability/lower costs.
- Configurable rate limits so your players don't rack up substantial translation costs.
- Persistent translation sessions saved per player across server reboots and reloads.
- Stat tracker to keep track of how your players use this plugin.
- A configuration GUI to easily change your config.yml + add/override custom localizations.
- SQL (MariaDB/MySQL) + PostgreSQL + MongoDB Support.

And much more to come!
