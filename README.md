### WorldwideChat is a translation plugin for Bukkit, Spigot, and PaperMC 1.13+.
It allows you to translate Minecraft live using several Translation APIs.
Some of its notable features include:
- IBM Watson, Google Translate, Libre Translate, and Amazon Translate support.
- An interactive configuration GUI.
- Translate chat, signs, entities, and written books with an interactive GUI.
- Translation globally, for other players, or just you.
- The plugin itself has been translated into more than 30 languages.
- A cache that stores the most used phrases by players on your server, improving speed and reliability in the event of slow API response times.
- Rate limits so your players don't fill up a quota too quickly.
- Persistent translation options saved per player across server reboots and reloads.
- Stat tracker to keep track of how your players use this plugin.
- MySQL Support.

And much more to come!
