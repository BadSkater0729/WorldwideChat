	/* TODO, eventually, maybe. The fact that I even have to do this sucks.
	 * Supporting versions as old as 1.13/1.12 is pretty annoying,
	 * since the modern spigot API covers most things that NMS covers.
	 * And to be honest, I'd like to avoid NMS if I can.
	 * It gives the plugin a much higher chance of being compatible with the next MC update.
	 * It also reduces clutter in my eyes.
	 * Thank god for ReflectionUtils, though! This shouldn't be too bad,
	 * and I won't need to deal with maven submodules (for now) if I do need NMS in the future.
